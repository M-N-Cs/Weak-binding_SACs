Supplementary data for the paper titled "Why Do Weak-Binding M-N-C Single-Atom Catalysts Still Possess Anomalously High Oxygen Reduction Activity in Alkaline Media?" The CONTCAR-type structures utilized for deriving scaling relations, analyzing electric field response, and investigating solvation effects are included in CONTCARs.
