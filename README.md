# Weak-binding_SACs

The CONTCAR-type structures utilized for deriving scaling relations, analyzing electric field response, and investigating solvation effects are included in CONTCARs. 

An online database that reveals the activity of weak-binding Cu/Ni-M-C catalysts under alkaline and acidic conditions and their pH dependence can be accessed at: https://www.digcat.org
